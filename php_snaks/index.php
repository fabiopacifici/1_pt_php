Challenge Description:
Create a simple PHP script that takes a user's name through a GET request and prints a greeting message to the user. If no name is provided, it should print a default greeting message.

Hint:
You can access the parameters passed through a GET request using the $_GET superglobal array. Check if the 'name' key exists and is not empty before using it.

Starting Code:
<?php
